# Classification of Breast Cancer diagnosis Using Support Vector Machines

Since the labels in the data are discrete, the predication falls into two categories, (i.e. Malignant or benign). In machine learning, this is a classification problem.
Machine learning is widely used in bioinformatics and particularly in breast cancer diagnosis. In this project, I used classification method that is Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is a supervised learning method to detect breast cancer.

1 = Malignant (Cancerous) - Present

0 = Benign (Not Cancerous) -Absent
